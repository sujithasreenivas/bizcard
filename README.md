Problem Statement
This project aim is to develop a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR. The extracted information should include the company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin code. The extracted information should then be displayed in the application's graphical user interface (GUI). In addition, the application should allow users to save the extracted information into a database along with the uploaded business card image. The database should be able to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted information. To achieve this, you will need to use Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and a database management system like SQLite or MySQL. 
Requirements
•	image processing, easyOCR
•	open CV
•	Python
•	Streamlit
•	Mysql
Workflow
1. Install the required packages: You will need to install Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and a database management system like  MySQL. 
2.Connect to mysql with mysql.connector.connect
3.Extract relevant information fro business card using easyocr
4.Display the extracted information in the dashboard
5.Upload all the extracted information to mysql database.
6.Improve the application by adding new features, optimizing the code, and fixing bugs.
Results: 
The result of the project would be a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR. The extracted information would include the company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin code. The extracted information would then be displayed in the application's graphical user interface (GUI). The application would also allow users to save the extracted information into a database along with the uploaded business card image. The database would be able to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted information. The final application would have a simple and intuitive user interface that guides users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its information. The extracted information would be displayed in a clean and organized manner, and users would be able to easily add it to the database with the click of a button. The project would require skills in image processing, OCR, GUI development, and database management. It would also require careful design and planning of the application architecture to ensure that it is scalable, maintainable, and extensible.
